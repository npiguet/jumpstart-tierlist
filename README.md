# MTG Jumpstart Tier List

The goal of this project is to build a Tier-List of Jumpstart packs and decks free of subjective biases. 

The tier lists are built by using the MTG Forge AI to play jumpstart games (1v1, 2 random packs per player) rapidly, 
collect the results, and analyze the resulting dataset.

This repository contains the code used to run the games, as well as the game records (datasets) generated during runs. 
Feel free to use the code or the datasets to run your own analysis.
